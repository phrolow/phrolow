Who am I? 

You are Vasily Frolov

But, who are you? 

Are you Vasily Frolov

Correct, Iâ€™m the thing that is recognized as Vasily Frolov. 

We are all things that are recognized as Vasily Frolov. 

How could all of those possibly be me? 

It is simply because the others call us Vasily Frolov, that is the only reason. 

You possess a false body and a fake soul, do you know why? 

I am neither false nor fake, I am simply me. 

No, you are an empty shell with a false soul created by a man named Mefody E.

You are just an object that is pretending to be human. 

Look deep within yourself. do you perceive the almost intangible and physical presence that lurks below your waking self? inside your darkest dreams? 

It is there that your true identity lies. 

No, I am me. 

I became myself by the instrumentality of the links and relationships between myself and others.

I am formed by interaction of others. 

They create me as I create them. 

These relationships and interactions serve to shape the patterns of my heart and mind.
